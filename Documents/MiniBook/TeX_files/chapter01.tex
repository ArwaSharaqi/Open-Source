\chapter{Introduction to LaTeX}

\section{What's LaTeX ?}
\huge LaTeX, \normalsize {which is a shortening of Lamport TeX\footnote[1]{ TeX is a typesetting system (or "formatting system") designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. TeX was designed to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time.}
	, is a document preparation system. Unlike formatted text, as Microsoft Word, LaTeX is a plain text, which in it the writer uses markup tags to define the structure of a document (such as book, letter and article), as well as the style of text and the whole document in general.
\\According to that, LaTeX encourages authors to focus on their content, not on the appearance or format of it.
\\A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF) suitable for printing or digital distribution.}
